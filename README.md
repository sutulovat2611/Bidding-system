External libraries used in our app:
1. ABC: This module provides the infrastructure for defining abstract base classes (ABCs) in Python
2. requests: The requests module allows you to send HTTP requests using Python.The HTTP request returns a 
Response Object with all the response data (content, encoding, status, etc).
3. json: a built-in package, which can be used to work with JSON data.
4. tkinter: the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
5. datetime: a date in Python is not a data type of its own, but we can import a module named datetime to work 
with dates as date objects.
6. dateutil: provides powerful extensions to the standard datetime module, available in Python.
7. PIL: The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter.This library provides 
extensive file format support, an efficient internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities.
8. threading: Using threads allows a program to run multiple operations concurrently in the same process space.
